ros-melodic-interactive-markers (1.11.1-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Added explicit keyword argument queue_size for publisher in Python code and use the same default queue_size value as C++.
  * Fixed a SEGFAULT in setPose reported in #18 <https://github.com/ros-visualization/interactive_markers/issues/18>
    Previously, calling setPose() on an interactive marker causes a SEGFAULT
    if applyChanges() was not called on the server at least once since the
    marker was created. I traced the actual SEGFAULT to the doSetPose
    function. The value of header passed from setPose() is invalid because,
    in this case, marker_context_it = marker_contexts_.end().
    I added a check for this case and, if there is no marker is present,
    instead use the header from the pending update.
